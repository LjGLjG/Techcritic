Build a miniature tumor and test cancer drugs on it, and see which of these drugs work and which ones don\u2019t.

So companies are really excited to be working with this technology and it\u2019s something they\u2019ve been looking for for a while. And as far as what we see it replacing in the future, in places like Europe where they\u2019ve banned animal testing in cosmetics that\u2019s a key area we can go into and begin being that replacement for animals. And eventually we see it being a replacement for the entire clinical development of drugs.", "\n", "Ideally if you\u2019re going to test drugs on one person at a time you\u2019d develop drugs very specifically for that person but nobody wants to be that guinea pig.

And after I graduated we literally bought three Ikea desks, pushed off the furniture on top of a bar where we were living and we stumbled across these sets of chemistry that people had used for a wide variety of different applications. We were looking for something we could use to not kill the cells, basically. And we stumbled into this \u2014 basically it\u2019s a compound \u2014 it\u2019s a chemical that works with visible light. And thought that sounds awesome. And we tried it and it worked really well. Nobody has actually used visible light \u2014 in the IP landscape \u2014 for building 3D living tissues. And so that was a space that we thought we can really own. And it makes a lot of sense for biology. So we filed those patents earlier this year.

I got to try out several different types of bands: a fluoroelastomer sport band, the Milanese loop, and the $449 Link Bracelet (though it wasn\u2019t adjusted, so it hung rather loosely on my wrist). For my pre-order, I don\u2019t need anything more than the sport band (which is surprisingly comfy compared to the rubber bands that come with most fitness trackers, if a bit tricky to put on the first time), but eventually I could see myself occasionally accessorizing with one of the more premium bands.", "\n", "The Sport model is light, so it\u2019ll be comfortable to wear while you work out. \u00a0With that said,\u00a0I\u2019m a bit anxious about scratching up my Watch\u2019s face, so I decided to at least give the steel Watch a chance.

Tech companies who have released smartwatches have been widely criticized for (among other things) creating products that do not feel or look like the timepieces anyone actually wants to wear. I\u2019ve personally suggested in the past that one successful formula for making the smartwatch relevant (and even exciting) is to combine the mutual talents of the Swiss watch industry and Silicon Valley. This seems to be precisely what TAG Heuer has done in partnership with Intel and Google\u2019s Android Wear operating system.", "\n", "Arguably one of ", "Android", " Wear\u2019s most serious challenges the dearth of actually attractive and useful smartwatch devices. Tech companies may try to emulate the look and feel of a traditional watch but none other than Apple have come even close to matching the quality, design, and detailing of a Swiss timepiece. Is there a market for a finely designed, premium smartwatch product that can compete on the same playing field as what is currently being made by the top timepiece brands from Europe?", "\n", "TAG Heuer seems to think so, and may be a less than surprising partner for companies such as Intel who has dabbled in the wearables world but has yet to make a real splash. Back in 2008 when TAG Heuer was perhaps at the height of diversifying its brand, in addition to making timepieces TAG Heuer was actually producing other products like eyewear and luxury smartphones. That\u2019s right: for a moment they tried to sell the Meridiist, a ritzy phone meant to compete with the lifestyle mobile phones made by Vertu.

These digital watches helped sailors see immediate and real time data about their ship while competing.", "\n", "Bringing a smartwatch to market for a mainstream set of consumers is a different challenge than working for a well-funded team of a few people you are sponsoring the efforts (Larry Ellison\u2019s America\u2019s Cup sailing team) or producing a fancier version of an establish product like the cellphone. For instance, no one ever claimed that luxury smartphones were better than average phone, in many situations they are much worse.

", "\n", "Whether or not the new TAG Heuer smartwatch will be a \u201cgood\u201d smartwatch is actually less important than how quickly consumers overall adopt smartwatches. Once these new, connected wearable devices hit the mainstream there will quickly be a separation between those for most people, and those produced for the luxury buying demographic \u2013 and various companies have their own perspective on that. Recently, Swiss company Frederique Constant partnered with Fullpower\u2019s Motion X technology to produce the MMT Horological Smartwatch platform that seeks to turn a traditional looking analog-dial timepiece into an activity tracker. Without a clear preference by consumers a successful smartwatch platform is something that is companies are looking to find. TAG Heuer takes the more typical approach to the smartwatch solution by going directly with a digital screen combined with their own high-end case construction and sense of modern, edgy styling.
